Hi!
This project includes the Parser I wrote during the Spring semester of my sophomore year at Skidmore. 
I completed this project during a Programming Languages class where I learned the skills to code a Parser in any language. 
I chose Python as I think it is the most readable and user friendly language.
I also included the grammar Prof. David Read gave my class to write the Parser off of.
